#### Variables, Expressions, and Statements

* Python performs floor division, for instance when both of the operands are integers, the result is also an integer (5/3 = 1)
-> if either of the operands is a floating-point number, python performs floating point division (5.0/3 = 1.666667)
* String operations: the '+' operator concatenates strings & the '*' operator performs repetition.  


#### Functions

 * Built-in type conversion function: int(), float(), str()
 * Statements inside functions are not executed until the function is called
 * Arguments are evaluated before the function is called


#### Case Study: Interface Design

 * for loop: for i in range(x, y):
 * Docstring: multiline (triple-quoted) string at the begining of a function that explains the interface
 * Preconditions: requirements/conditions on the functions arguments
 * Postconditions: effect of the function and any side effects


#### Conditionals and Recursion

* Logical operators: and, or & not
* elif is an abbreviation of "else if"
* keyboard input: raw_input (python 2) & input (python 3)


#### Fruitful functions

* The return statement can include an expression (return 3*4)
* Check type of a var: isinstance(var, type)


#### Strings

* Methods: len('mystring'), 'mysring'[n:m] (slice), 'mystring'.upper(), 'mystring'.find('charorstring'), .count(), .strip(), .replace()
* In: boolean operator


#### Case study: World play

* Methods on files: file = open('file_path'), line = file.readline(), word = line.strip()
