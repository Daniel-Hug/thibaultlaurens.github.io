Hi, my name is **Thibault Laurens**,I am a 23 years old french student living in Oxford, United Kingdom!

Like the logo in the footer, yes I am **nuts about tech**! 

Software programming is my daily passion. I like to learn new things every day, to use the right technology for the right job and to find simple solutions to real life problems. 

C# and the Microsoft technology stack are my favorite playground but I also like to work with other interesting languages and open source frameworks. 

I am currently working on my master's dissertation: **“A web architecture for highly scalable application in JavaScript”**, a very interesting topic!

What am I doing here in the **UK**?

I landed here in October 2011 in order to continue my studies for
<a href="http://www.supinfo.com/en/Default.aspx" title="supinfo.com" target="_blank"><strong>SUPINFO International University</strong></a> 
, but also to improve my English and to discover a new culture.
I spend an amazing year in London and I move in September 2012 to Oxford.
I currently study a master's degree in Computer Science at
<a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/" title="brookes.ac.uk" target="_blank"><strong>Oxford Brookes University</strong></a> 
and I really enjoy it!

I am also a budding photographer (just
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thibaultlaurens/" title="flickr.com/photos/thibaultlaurens" target="_blank">here</a>)
 who loves to travel, meet new people and explore the world.

Feel free to contact me, I am looking for a new challenge and exciting opportunities to bring me up to the next level!
